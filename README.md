<h1>Hey 👋</h1>

<p>Below is a quote from a book I read when I first got started with web design/development back in the late 90s early 2000s, it still applies to how I see my skills and interests:</p>

<p>“There are no artists working in the interface medium who are not, in one way or another, engineers as well. This has always been the case with culture and technology, of course; it's just that we used to pretend it was otherwise, <code>by dutifully keeping the painters and the mechanics separate, on the college campuses, in the museum halls, on the bookshelves</code>⸺wherever the twain had the slightest chance of meeting.</p>
<p>The artisans of interface culture don't bother wasting time with these arbitrary divisions. Their medium reinvents itself too quickly for <code>false oppositions between creative types and programmers.</code> They have become something else, some new fusion of artist and engineer⸺interfacers, cyberpunks, Web masters⸺charged with the epic task of representing our digital machines, making sense of information in its raw form.”</p>

<p>⸺ <em>Steven Johnson</em>, Interface Culture, 1997</p>
